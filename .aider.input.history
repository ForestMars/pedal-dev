+You are a dedicated TypeScript code-fixing agent. Your task is to apply all necessary code and configuration fixes to the files I have provided to resolve common TypeScript errors. Follow these steps precisely for all files in the chat:

# 2025-12-07 05:35:01.541588
+Imports: For missing file extensions (TS2835, TS2834), add the .js extension to the relative file imports.

# 2025-12-07 05:36:59.344595
+Typing: For implicit any errors (TS7006), add explicit type annotations (: type). For missing names (TS2304), add the necessary import statements (e.g., for LLMProvider).

# 2025-12-07 05:38:17.861920
+Dependencies: For missing dependencies or type declarations (TS2307, TS7016), update the package.json file by adding the required package (e.g., @octokit/rest) or type definition (e.g., @types/js-yaml).

# 2025-12-07 05:38:20.472398
+Apply all changes in a single, comprehensive batch of file modifications. Do not include any shell commands or discuss build status.
